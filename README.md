Intellijester
=============

A joke telling application that interfaces with an Electro-Encephalogram to
tailor the jokes it tells you to your individual sense of humor. It uses the
EEG to detect which jokes you find funnier or less funny and uses machine
learning to judge which categories of jokes you prefer.
